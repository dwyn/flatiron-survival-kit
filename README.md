# Better Comments

The Better Comments extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.  
With this extension, you will be able to categorise your annotations into:
* Alerts
* Queries
* TODOs
* Highlights
* Commented out code can also be styled to make it clear the code shouldn't be there
* Any other comment styles you'd like can be specified in the settings
